# Folio

fol.io is a platform where anyone can join and contribute to forums over any topic. As a user, you can simply scroll through other users' posts or post, comment, and reply to bring light to new ideas. If you enjoy content a user shares, you have the ability to upvote them. Users with highest amount of votes will be displayed on the front page. The voting system also applies for forum posts. However, comments use a liking system. Liking one's comment does not do anything special accept increase a virtual number (but people appreciate it when you like their comments). When another user replies to one of your comments, comments on your profile/post, or modifies your rank in a forum, you will receive a notification in your fol.io inbox.
